# School_District_Analysis
Python Week 4

## Overview of the School District Analysis
There has been evidence of academic dishonesty regarding the reading and math grades for 9th graders attending
Thomas High School. Because of this, the school district analysis needed to be recreated with the data for
Thomas High School 9th graders omitted from the dataset. To do this, all 9th grade Thomas High School student
scored were set to NaN in the data set.

## Results
### - Total Schools
Since Thomas High School only had grades omitted for 9th grade, data for grades 10, 11, and 12 were able to be
maintained within the dataset. Because of this, the total number of schools did not change.

### - Total Students
Since we only omitted the math and reading grades for the Thomas High School 9th graders, the total number of
students for the analysis was reduced from 39,170 to 38,709. In other words, there were 461 9th graders from
Thomas High School that were omitted from the analysis.

### - Total Budget
The total budget was not affected in the data set since each school was given a certain budget. Since the 
report of academic dishonesty was determined just prior to this analysis, the budget was already determined.

### - Average Math Score
With the Thomas High School 9th graders data removed from the dataset, the average math score hardly changed.
It went from 79.0 to 78.9, meaning it dropped only 0.1.

### - Average Reading Score
With the Thomas High School 9th graders data removed from the dataset, the average reading score stayed the 
same at 81.9.

### - % Passing Math
Due to having less overall students in the data set and the data for Thomas High School 9th graders omitted,
the overall % passing math dropped from 75.0% to 74.8%.

### - % Passing Reading
Due to having less overall students in the data set and the data for Thomas High School 9th graders omitted,
the overall % passing reading dropped from 85.8% to 85.7%.

### - % Overall Passing
Due to having less overall students in the data set and the data for Thomas High School 9th graders omitted,
the overall % of students passing dropped from 65.2% to 64.9%.

## Summary
In conclusion, due to the academic dishonesty relating the the Thomas High School 9th graders data we can
conclude that the overall average scores were inflated. This new data analysis shows the changes in the 
total student count, average math scores, average reading scores, and the overall % of students passing
were all affected.
